## Use Cases

#### Duplicate Releases Notes 

Image you have a private repo where you develop your SDK. Additionally, you've made publicly available a Repo with some documentation about your SDK module.

* private repo: [release-creator-example](https://github.com/alice-biometrics/release-creator-example)
* public repo: [release-creator-example-lib](https://github.com/alice-biometrics/release-creator-example-lib)

Use `release-creator` if you want to copy releases notes from one repo to another with:


From [release-creator-example-lib](https://github.com/alice-biometrics/release-creator-example-lib) :arrow_right: [release-creator-example](https://github.com/alice-biometrics/release-creator-example)

```yml
name: Release Creator

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  update:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Create a release
    steps:
